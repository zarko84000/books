# Books that I recommend for learning AI by yourself

- [Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem - Abhishek Thakur](https://www.amazon.com/Approaching-Almost-Machine-Learning-Problem-ebook/dp/B089P13QHT) 

Rate : ★★★★                               State of Advancement : Finish

Highly recommend for people that have already a little bit of pratical / theory in machine learning and deep learning.
You will need to know Sklearn & Pytorch before starting this book.
Has it is describe in the back cover book : 
> If you are looking for pure basics, this book is not for you. This book is for you if you are looking for guidance on approaching machine learning problems [...]
